# CalculateScrapForQuota

Another Lethal Company Mod

When you scan inside of the ship this mod will:
- Highlight optimal scrap to sell for quota.
- Tell you the total value of the optimal scrap to sell. 

If you don't have enough scrap to meet quota, then nothing extra will happen.

Known Issues:
Highlights are sometimes hard to see. (Yield/Stop Signs)
